// TASKS TODO (lol)

1. when creating a new task push it to the current users
2. fix user login so we can start 
3. understand how jade works so we include the user variable in todo list html page
4. Need to be able to add todos to the users "todo list"                 ]
5. Working on delete.
	- make sure to delete task itself
	- make sure to delete info about task on the creator users 
	- display currentusers todos, fix the hard code   

6. working on log out  
	- it should redirect to login page
